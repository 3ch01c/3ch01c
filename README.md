- 👋 Hi, I’m @3ch01c
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, teaching, and fighting evil.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning devops, cloud, politics, and business for good.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing solutions to the suffering of people that nobody wants to fix because it's not profitable to do so.
